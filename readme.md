# Welcome to Text Bot!
_The world's worst AI chatbot!_

## Introduction
We are on our quest to creating the world's first _truly responsive_ AI, however we don't know anything about machine learning so we'll settle for a bot that simulates a chat... Poorly at that.

## Setup
You've been given some starter code with a simple layout(HTML & CSS) with some classes and styles already given along with a `script.js` file containg some starter code for you.

## Assignment
You are tasked with the following: 
- Fill our `botResponses` array with at least 10 responses
- You should be able to add an event listener to our `button` so that when it is clicked, it will then take that response enter it in the `text-responses``div`. When you enter a response, the bot should then choose one of it's responses at random and simulate a response to your text.
